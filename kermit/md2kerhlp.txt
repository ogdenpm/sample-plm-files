Subject: MDS Kermit (finally!)
To: sy.fdc@CU20B

The sources for ISIS-Kermit (ISIS is the CPM-like operating system for the
8080-based Intel MDS) are in PS:<CC.FDC.TEMP>, along with a control file that
shows how they're linked together.  There isn't really any documentation
around, but the code is simple enough that it's not hard to figure out what's
going on.  Basically, it's just a 7-bit bare-bones (by 1982 standards) Kermit,
based more or less on the earliest C version.  It doesn't allow wildcards, but
you can specify multiple files on the "send" command line and receive multiple
commands from another Kermit; there's also some crude but useful debugging code
(the "d" command turns it on).

Sorry for the delay; I had to promise that the authors of the code would
remain anonymous, but feel free to give my number (280-8122) to the recipients
in case they have any questions about the MDS (in case theirs isn't really
compatible).
